> *In my work I made an assumption that a displayed message is one of the business requirements and should be implemented in the system. After execution of 4 test cases which were written to check Sign-On functionality, 1 has passed and 3 have failed. The reason of that is a lack of message which should be implemented in this module in a case when User enters invalid name or/and password or leaves these two fields blank. The “Invalid user name/password” message would help to reduce a risk of bad user experience and minimalize a risk of credentials theft.*
